\section*{Question 5-7}
	\paragraph{}
		Convert the 16-bit number in \$D500-\$D501 and each of the eight bit numbers in \$DB00-\$DB04
		to decimal and enter the information in the table below.  Repeat with a number between 00FF-0FFF.
		FInally, repeat this with a number between 0FFF-FFFF.

\section*{Question 8}
	\paragraph{â€¢}
		Choose a number between 10,000 and 65,535 to be stored in \$D500 and \$D501.  "Execute" the program 
		by hand and write down the impact of each instruction on the registers and memory locations involved in it.
		\vspace{1cm}
		\\Depending on the decimal or hexadecimal value you choose will effect when exactly in the program the 
		value of certain flags will be 1 or 0.  What we definitely know is that every program will effect the Zero, 
		Carry, and Overflow CPU registers.  
	
\section*{Question 9}
	\paragraph{}
		What do you think the program is doing?
		\vspace{1cm}
		\\This program is taking the value stored in \$D500 and converting it as the higher byte to decimal and
		taking the value stored in \$D501 as the lower byte to decimal.  In other words with \$D500 being the lower
		byte and \$D501 being the lower byte the value stored in them is converted from hexidecimal to decimal.
	
\section*{Question 10}
	\paragraph{}
		What do you think that XGDX is doing?
		\vspace{1cm}
		\\This instruction swaps the value in accumulator D with the value in the X register.  This is a more effective
		and efficient way to do this conversion than constantly pushing and pulling from a stack.
